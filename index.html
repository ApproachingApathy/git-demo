								In computer software engineering, revision
								control is any kind of practice that tracks and
								provides control over changes to source code.
								Software developers sometimes use revision
								control software to maintain documentation and
								configuration files as well as source code.

						Git
					</h1>
					<p>
						Git is the version control system that we use in this
						class. It's the most commonly used system. Git is what
						we interact with locally. It is a way to save
						snapshots(commits) of code so that we can easily make
						and reverse changes. Git makes it easier to update,
						maintain, and share code.

						GitHub
					</h1>
					<p>
						GitHub primarily is a Git Repo hosting service. It
						provides a centralized place to house and manage code
						under source control. GitHub uses git but did not make
						it. Github does add useful features to make collabation
						and deploying/releasing code easier, however.

					<h1 class="display-4">Git Workflow</h1>
					<hr class="my-6" />
					<p>
						A common git workflow use 'feature' branches. Branches
						take snapshots of code and separates them a working tree
						to allow them to be worked on in isolation.
					</p>
					<h2 class="display-5">
						Why Branch?
					</h2>
					<p>
						Branches enable multiple coders to work on different
						features or fixes concurrently without effecting the
						others. This means that the things other people are
						working on can't break your code. It also protects the
						'master' or production branch, from unfinished/untested
						code. Imagine writing code that breaks your company's
						website on black friday. By putting changes and
						in-progress work into separate branches, we reduce the
						likelihood of game-breaking changes being introduced
						into production code.
